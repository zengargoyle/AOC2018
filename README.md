# Advent of Code 2018

## Introduction

Each day has a directory that contains the code and input(s).

The first couple of days are mostly oneliners.  Look in the file named `history`.

The rest of the days so far are in the file named `test`.

The `input` file is the data from AOC, the `small` file (if present) is the short part 1 test data.
